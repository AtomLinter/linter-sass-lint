### 1.1.2
- Lock down eslint to 2.2.x due to [eslint #5476](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/5476)

### 1.1.1
- Updated eslint to ^2.2.0
- Updated eslint-config-airbnb to ^6.0.1

### 1.1.0
- Updated no config error messages to return info type lint warnings instead (popups are annoying)
- Updated a few package dependencies (eslint-config-airbnb, atom-package-deps)

### 1.0.5
- Temporarily locked down our dependency on `atom-package-deps` to v3.0.6

### 1.0.4
- Temporarily locked down our dependency on consistent-path to v1.0.3
- Updated to the airbnb's eslint config v5

### 1.0.3
- Unexpected parse errors and sass-lint issues are just reported as lint errors rather than the annoying red box of doom
- this will be updated in 1.1.0 to improve the way these are reported and handled, for now the errors will be logged to the console.

### 1.0.2
- Update eslint-config-airbnb to version 4.0.0

### 1.0.1
- Updated the README.md to reflect the latest option changes in 1.0.0

### 1.0.0
- Added 'Lint On Fly' support [#11](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-sass-lint/issues/11) thanks to [Casey Foster](https://github.com/caseywebdev)
- Removed the `executablePath` option
- Removed the ability to specify a path to a config you must now explicitly define a config file if you use this option
  - project configs remain untouched
  - this has been deprecated since 0.4.0
- Added a `globalSassLint` option to use your globally installed `sass-lint` package rather than the version included with `linter-sass-lint` [#3](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-sass-lint/issues/3)
- Automatically look to your global modules in the event the above option is enabled but you've not set your path prefix.
- Fixed an issue with ignored and included files options of your config being ignored, ignored files will now not be linted. See the `sass-lint` config file [documentation](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint/tree/master/docs) for more information on how to use this.

## Submitting Issues

* Before creating a new issue, perform a cursory search to see if a similar issue has already been submitted.
* You can create an issue [here](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-sass-lint/issues). Please include as many details as possible when filing an issue.
* Issue titles should be descriptive, explaining at the high level what it is about.
* Please include the version of linter-sass-lint being used and your Atom version
* Please include full error messages/output when submitting issues where appropriate.

## Pull Requests

* Pull requests should reference their related issues where possible. If the pull request closes an issue, [please reference its closing from a commit messages](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/).
* Pull request titles should be descriptive, explaining at the high level what it is doing, and should be written in the same style as [Git commit messages](#git-commit-messages).
* Follow our Coffeescript styleguides. We have linters set up to catch most of it.
* Ensure that [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) installed in the editor and that it is functioning properly.
* Do not squash or rebase commits when submitting a Pull Request. It makes it much harder to follow work and make incremental changes.
* Ensure no Emoji tags are used in the title of the Pull Request

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense (`"Add feature"` not `"Added Feature"`)
* Use the imperative mood (`"Move cursor to…"` not `"Moves cursor to…"`)
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Include relevant Emoji from our [Emoji cheatsheet](#emoji-cheatsheet)
